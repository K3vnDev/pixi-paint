# ðŸŽ¨ Pixi Paint

A minimalistic 8x pixel-art web app built with **Next.js** + **Zustand**.

## Features

* **Free Paint:** 8Ã—8 pixel canvas with unlimited colors. Publish anonymously.
* **Gallery:** Browse all published artworks.
* **Challenge Mode:** Memorize an 8Ã—8 pixel art for a few seconds, then recreate it with a limited palette and get scored.
* **No Logins:** Plug & play, zero friction.

## Planned (maybe...)

* **Party Mode:** Multiplayer rooms using WebSockets (like Gartic Phone but with pixels).
* **AI Judge (maybe):** Solo mode where AI scores your drawing based on a topic.
